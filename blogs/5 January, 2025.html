                        Over the past few years, we've seen an explosive trend in the use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT,
                        Midjourney, Dall-E 2, Sora AI, and so many other AI
                        models, that it's hard to even count them all.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                        What may you ask is the problem with all these AI models? It is too accessible, too good at what
                        it does, and it devalues human work. From art
                        commissions, to graphic design... AI can fill the shoes of nearly everybody in the job market
                        today who works normal office jobs. Even though AI may
                        not do many things perfectly, it still does enough to cause a massive disruption in the job
                        market world-wide.
                    </p>

                        So what can we do about all this? All we can do is sit back, and watch, because this is the next
                        best thing since the birth of the internet. It will
                        only improve more and more, and that's a scary thought. We will have to choose career paths
                        based on when, if at all, it will be
                        replaced by AI. Blue collar jobs are slowly making a comeback, as robotics still has lightyears
                        ahead to go before it can do everything a human can do.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                        Why are blue collar jobs safe for the time being? Something as simple as washing, packing, and
                        drying dishes, requires a lot of knowledge of physics.
                        It requires the ability to handle objects in a fluid, natural way, which often requires a lot of
                        clever manouvering of fingers, arms, etc. This
                        processing power the human mind has, is still far better than any robot of today. Humans are
                        just so hyper-aware of their surroundings, how objects
                        behave, how mass vs. object texture comes together to form decisions, such as, "Can I manage to
                        carry these three objects without them being at risk
                        of falling?" When you really sit and think about it... This is just dishes we're talking about.
                        What about cooking? Cooking for people at a restaurant?
                        Now, AI doesn't seem like such a threat anymore, because these robots need specially-designed
                        spaces to do their tasks. They are rigid, and limited in
                        what they can do.
                    </p>

                        We are entering a true cyberpunk dystopia, and it's not gonna look as pretty as the music,
                        movie, and visual art genre. My prediction is that the world
                        is gonna be owned by a handful of mega-corporations. There will be poor wastelands stretching
                        over most of the populated area on Earth, and we'll have a
                        few super rich cities dotted around, exploiting the poor masses to keep up their infrastructure.
                        The only food that the poor can afford, are blocks or
                        packets of bug gel, sold by one of the mega-corporations. The super rich get to afford real
                        meat, vegetables, fruits, grains, etc., which are farmed
                        within the safe confines of these walled cities. But that's just my prediction. This may not
                        ever happen.

                        I do not have a problem with AI itself. The problem I have, is that people are trying to
                        shoehorn AI into a capitalistic world. If we weren't living
                        in a system, where we should work to earn a piece of paper called "money", then I wouldn't have
                        a problem with AI. If there was a system where we could
                        do what we wanted, whenever we wanted, then AI is more than welcome, because it actually
                        improves our quality of life even more, because it's not
                        threatening our existence.
